            <p class="bio-text">Hello reader! My name is Natasha AKA Tash. I live in Buckinghamshire, in Milton Keynes, which is often known only as 'that place with all the roundabouts' - 124 and counting, I believe. I am a cat-person with no cats (yet!) and I recently got engaged to my partner of six wonderful years.</p>
            <p class="bio-text">I've worked for almost a decade in retail operations, but web design has always held my interest. After a covid-based redundancy, I made the decision to plunge head-first into making waves to break into web design as my next career. I've been studying with The Open University for two years now, working towards a BSc (Honours) degree in Computing and IT, and will soon be specialising in a web design route. I've also completed a handful of Codecademy courses in various languages:</p>

                <li><img id="js-icon"/></li>
                <li><img id="react-icon"/></li>
                <li><img id="jquery-icon"/></li>
                <li><img id="vs-icon"/></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="bio-text">And completed the Microsoft MTA: Intro to Programming with HTML and CSS exam:</p>

            <img id="mta-badge" href="./images/mta.png"/>

            <p class="bio-text">I also hold a Foundation Degree in Graphic Design and have had my work from this recognised in a few settings, such as being used to theme an award ceremony for MK College, having a book cover design published, and having some of my work displayed at Centre:MK for an arts show.</p>
            <p class="bio-text">Whilst it is true that most of my time now is spent either studying, working, or coding, I still find a little time here and there for other outlets. Gaming, reading, and Marvel movies are all of interest to me, but I also try to create things in different ways too. During my graphics study, I came across a little-known craft called quilling - the art of manipulating thin strips of paper into beautiful works. It's time-consuming, fiddly as anything and can be incredibly frustrating - and I love it! To give you an idea, here's one of my early pieces:</p>

            <p class="bio-text">Well reader, I hope you found this little slice of my life interesting. If you wish to take a look at some projects I've completed, these are available here. Or If you would like to reach out, all of my contact details are available here. I would love to hear from you!</p>
