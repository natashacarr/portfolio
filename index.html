          Hello reader! My name is Natasha AKA Tash. I live in Buckinghamshire
          in Milton Keynes, recognisable to most as 'that place with all the
          roundabouts'. I am a cat-person with no cats (yet!) and I recently got
          engaged to my partner of six wonderful years.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I've worked for almost a decade in retail operations, but web design
          has always held my interest. After a Covid-driven redundancy, I made
          the decision to plunge head-first into making waves to break into web
          design as my next career. I've been studying with The Open University
          for two years now, working towards a BSc (Honours) degree in Computing
          and IT, and will soon be specialising in a web design route. I've also
          completed a handful of Codecademy courses in various languages, as
          well as completed the Microsoft MTA: Intro to Programming with HTML
          and CSS exam.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="bio-text">
          I hold a Foundation Degree in Graphic Design and have had work from
          this recognised in a few settings, such as being used to theme an
          award ceremony for MK College, having a book cover design published,
          and having some of my work displayed at Centre:MK for an arts show.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          Whilst most of my time is spent studying, working, or coding, I still
          find time here and there for other outlets. Gaming, reading, and
          Marvel movies are all things I enjoy, and I also like creating things
          with paper using a technique called quilling.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="bio-text">
          If you wish to take a look at some projects I've worked on, these are
          available <a class="bio-link" href="./projects.html">here</a>. Or If
          you would like to reach out, all of my contact details are available
          <a class="bio-link" href="./contact.html">here</a>. I would love to
          hear from you!
