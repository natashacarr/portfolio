            <p class="bio-text">Hello reader! My name is Natasha AKA Tash. I live in Buckinghamshire, in Milton Keynes, which is often known only as 'that place with all the roundabouts' - 124 and counting, I believe. I am a cat-person with no cats (yet!) and I recently got engaged to my partner of six wonderful years.</p>
            <p class="bio-text">I've worked for almost a decade in retail operations, but web design has always held my interest. After a covid-driven redundancy, I made the decision to plunge head-first into making waves to break into web design as my next career. I've been studying with The Open University for two years now, working towards a BSc (Honours) degree in Computing and IT, and will soon be specialising in a web design route. I've also completed a handful of Codecademy courses in various languages, as well as completed the Microsoft MTA: Intro to Programming with HTML and CSS exam.</p>
            <br/>

            <p class="bio-text">I hold a Foundation Degree in Graphic Design and have had work from this recognised in a few settings, such as being used to theme an award ceremony for MK College, having a book cover design published, and having some of my work displayed at Centre:MK for an arts show.</p>
            <p class="bio-text">Whilst most of my time is spent studying, working, or coding, I still find time here and there for other outlets. Gaming, reading, and Marvel movies are all things I enjoy, and I also like creating things with paper using a technique called quilling.</p>
            <br/>

            <p class="bio-text">Well reader, I hope you found this little slice of my life interesting. If you wish to take a look at some projects I've worked on, these are available <a class="bio-link" href="./projects.html">here</a>. Or If you would like to reach out, all of my contact details are available <a class="bio-link" href="./projects.html">here</a>. I would love to hear from you!</p>
